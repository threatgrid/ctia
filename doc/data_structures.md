# Data Structures

[Data Model Graph](model.png)
[Data Model Graph as `.dot` ](model.dot)

The data model of CTIA is closely based on
[STIX](http://stixproject.github.io/data-model/) with a few
simplifications:

  * The base Types cannot be documented inside of each other.  It's
  like always having to use an _idref_.  This is because we intend to
  build a hypermedia threat intel web combining global and local
  threat intel.

  * It's built on top of a "verdict service" so we simplify
  Observables into their most commonly observed properties.  You no
  longer have to say, "a file, with the sha256 checksum equal to X"
  you would simple say, "a sha256 checksum".  We cross index
  everything on these observables, and distill the indicators down
  into verdicts that allow q quick looking to see if an observable is
  of interest.

  * We flatten some structured data to make it easier to deal with as
  JSON and simpler, since we are dealing with specific cases in CTIA.
  We will use default vocabularies whenever they are available.

  * We assume specific string representations for descriptions and
  such, instead of the more complex structured data which allows the
  specification of multiple formats.  This is to enforce a more secure
  representation fromat suitable for embedding in web applications.

## Indicator

An indicator is a test, or a collection of judgements that define
criteria for identifying the activity, or presence of malware, or
other unwanted software.

We follow the
[STiX IndicatorType](http://stixproject.github.io/data-model/1.2/indicator/IndicatorType/)
closely, with the exception of not including observables within the
indicator, and preferring a _specification_ object encoded in JSON as
opposed to an opaque _implemntation_ block.

Additional, you will want to either define judgements against
Observables that are linked to this indicator, with the ID in the
_indicators_ field of those Judgements, or you can provide a
_specification_ value.

JSON Example:

```json
{
  "description": ["Indicator example"],
  "producer": "test",
  "observable": {
    "value": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
    "type": "sha256"},
  "type": ["File Hash Watchlist"],
  "title": "string",
  "expires": "2016-02-22T20:49:30.766Z",
  "confidence": "High",
  "valid_time_position": {
    "start_time": "2016-02-10T20:49:30.767Z",
    "end_time": "2016-02-15T20:49:30.767Z"}

## Judgement

A statement about the intent of an Observable.  Since a core goal of
the CTIA is to provide a simple verdict service, these judgements are
the basis for the returned verdicts.  These are also the primary means
by which users of the CTIA go from observables on their system, to the
indicators and threat intelligence data in CTIA.

### Judgement Example

Here is a quick example using curl:

```shell
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"observable":{"type":"ip", "value":"127.0.0.1"},
     "disposition":2, "source":"internet chat forum"}' "http://localhost:3000/ctia/judgements"

<a name="verdict"/>
## Verdict

The Verdict is chosen from all of the Judgements on that Observable which
have not yet expired.  The highest priority Judgement becomes the
active verdict.  If there is more than one Judgement with that
priority, than Clean disposition has priority over all others, then
Malicious disposition, and so on down to Unknown.

| Key               | Value                                       | Mandatory? |

| disposition\_name | [DispositionName](#disposition_name)        |            |

The disposition_name field is optional, but is intended to be show to
a user.  Applications must therefore remember the mapping of numbers
to human words.

Stored instances will also receive the following fields, but MAY not be shared:

| Key     | Value         | Description                               |

| created | [Time](#time) | Timestamp when object was created in CTIA |
| owner   | string        | String identifying the creating user      |

## Shared Structures

<a name="id"/>
### ID

string

The ID field is related to the [Referene](#reference) field.  IDs are
strings of the form: type-<128bitUUID>, for example
`judgment-de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014` for a
[Judgement](#judgement).

The CTIA _ID_ field compares to the STIX _id_ field.  The optional STIX
_idref_ field is not used.

<a name="uri"/>
### URI

string

<a name="time"/>
### Time

Time is stored internally as a java.util.Date object, serialized as a
string the field should follow the rules of the ISO8601 standard.

### Observable

An observable is a simple, atomic value that denotes an entity which
as an identity that is stable enough to be attributed an intent or
nature.  These do not exist as objects within the CTIA storage model,
you never create an observable.

<a name="relationship_structures"/>
## Relationship Structures

There are two types of relationship structures:

1. References; see [Reference](#reference) below.
2. Related object structures, which contain references along with
   meta data about the relationship.

<a name="reference"/>
<a name="actor_reference"/>
<a name="campaign_reference"/>
<a name="coa_reference"/>
<a name="exploit_target_reference"/>
<a name="feedback_reference"/>
<a name="identity_reference"/>
<a name="incident_reference"/>
<a name="indicator_reference"/>
<a name="judgement_reference"/>
<a name="source_reference"/>
<a name="ttp_reference"/>
<a name="verdict_reference"/>
### Reference

A string identifier that points to a stored data structure.  Named
references in this document (in the form of _FooReference_) indicate
the type of object that is being pointed to.

A reference may be an [ID](#id) when the object is available on the
same CTIA instance.  When the reference points to a remote CIA
instance, the reference must be full URL, such as
`https://ctia.someplace.else.org/judgement/de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014`
and that object should be retrievable at that URI.
