Errors are handled per entities. If an entitiy is not visible to a user or does not exist, its id will be indicated as not found. If the user can read the entity but not delete it (ex: tlp green and max-record-visibility set to "everyone"), its id will be indicated as not found.
The example below shows a response with a mix of not-found, forbidden and deleted entities:

* Bundle

The bundle routes are like bulk but with extra processing helpers to ease large import/export.

** Bundle Import

The `/bundle` API endpoint allows users with the correct permissions to POST a CTIM [bundle object](https://github.com/threatgrid/ctim/blob/master/src/ctim/schemas/bundle.cljc).

The ability to post bundles is controlled by the `import-bundle` capability.

When a bundle is submitted:

1. All entities that have already been imported with the external ID whose prefix has been configured with the `ctia.store.external-key-prefixes` property are searched.
2. If they are identified by transient IDs, a mapping table between transient and stored IDs is built.
3. Only new entities are created in the same way as the `/bulk` API endpoint with transient IDs resolutions. Existing entities are not modified.

If more than one entity is referenced by the same external ID, an error is reported.

Example for an incident along with its context, note the transient ids

** Bundle Export

Bundle Export offers to retrieve many entities from their ids along with corresponding relationships and directly linked entities.

| query Params                | values                     | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| `:related_to`               | `target_ref`, `source_ref` | The direction of the relationships to retrieve.       |
| `:source_type`              | valid entity type          | the type of the source entities.                      |
| `:target_type`              | valid entity type          | the type of the target entitites                      |
| `:include_related_entities` | `true`, `false``           | Shall the related entities be included in the result? |

The Bundle Export is exposed with a POST and a GET route. The Post route is meant for large Bundle Export queries.

Examples:
#+begin_src HTTP
POST /ctia/bundle/export HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: "Bearer ..."
accept: application/json

{
  "ids": [
    "incident-1",  "incident-2", ... "incident-100"
  ]

#+end_src

#+begin_src HTTP
GET /ctia/bundle/export?id=incident-1&id=incident-2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: "Bearer ..."
accept: application/json
#+end_src

Returns
