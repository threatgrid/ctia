# Cisco Threat Intel API

A Pragmattic, Operationalized Threat Intel Service and Data Model

For full documentation see [doc/index.md](doc/index.md)

We also think the [Use Cases](doc/use_cases.md) document is a good
starting point.

Interactive, browser based documentation for the API is available once
you have it running, at:

    http://localhost:3000/index.html

## Goals

 * Sharing actionable threat intel
 * Simple, pragmatic data model
 * Ease of integration and exploration
 * Extremely fast Verdict lookups
 * Hypertextual integration with other services

This is not a full STIX/TAXII service.  Its intent is to help
Analysts know what is important, and for detection and prevention
tools to know what to look for.

In addition to the RESTful HTTP API, it also has an Event Bus.

The data model is define in the [CTIM](/threatgrid/ctim) project,
although it's quite easy to see the API and the models it handles
using the built-in [Swagger UI](http://localhost:3000/index.html) once
you have it running.

CTIA is implemented in [Clojure](http://clojure.org), and if you need
a crash course in running clojure projects, check out
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/).

## Usage

### Data Stores and External Dependencies

CTIA uses Leiningen as it's "build" tool, you can install it by
following the instructions here: http://leiningen.org/#install

By default, CTIA uses Elasticsearch 5.x as it's data store.  Assuming you
have it running on 127.0.0.1:9200 you can simply start
CTIA.

You can jump to the [Developer](#Developer) section to see instructions
on how to run elasticsearch and other optional supporting tools using
Docker.  CTIA can use redis to store some of it's objects (Verdicts)
and also can send streams of events to Redis and Elasticsearch.

### Run the application locally

Running from a cloned repository:

`lein run`

If you like, you can cider-connect to the NREPL listener that it
starts by default.  Be sure NOT to run the service this way in
production, unless you ensure access to the NREPL port is restricted.

### Packaging and running as standalone jar

This is the proper way to run this in production.

```
lein do clean, uberjar
java -Xmx4g -Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Dlog.console.threshold=INFO -jar target/ctia.jar
```

Obviously, one may tweak the java arguments as needed.

## Development

We provide a default `docker-compose-dev.yml` which will bring up the
dependencies you need in containers.


The easiest way to get running is to use `docker`.

On Mac OS X, you should use
[Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) which
includes all the dependencies you need to run Docker containers.

You can then bring up a development environemnt:

```
cd containers/dev
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

If you can't use docker directly and are forced to use Docker Toolbox,
you will then need to tell your CTIA where to find it's dependencies.
The services will be listening on your docker-machine's IP, which you
can get with the command, `docker-machine ip`, and then you define
your own `resources/ctia.properties` file with the following values:

```
ctia.store.es.default.host=192.168.99.100
ctia.store.es.default.port=9200
ctia.hook.es.host=192.168.99.100
ctia.hook.es.port=9200
ctia.hook.redis.host=192.168.99.100
ctia.hook.redismq.host=192.168.99.100
```

Or you could initialize your properties with:

```
lein init-properties
```

It can be very useful to use _Kitematic_ to monitor and interact with
your containers.  You can also use _VirtualBox_ to modify the
resources available to the VM that is running all of your containers.

If you ever need to reset your entire dev environemnt, you can run
`docker-compose` to rebuild all the containers from scratch:

```
cd containers/dev
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate
```

Now, in another terminal, you can run CTIA.


### Testing and CI

All PRs must pass `lein test` with no fails.  All new code should have
tests accompanying it.

## Data Model

The data model of CTIA is closely based on
[STIX](http://stixproject.github.io/data-model/), with a few
simplifications.  See [Cisco Threat Intel Model](https://github.com/threatgrid/ctim/tree/master/doc/) for details.
