STIX project data structures converted to Prismatic schemas

* TODOs

  - [ ] Pull judgment out of models.clj
  - [ ] Pull verdict out of models.clj
  - [ ] Document in README how to transformations (with variations),
    including notes for serialization
  - [ ] "Extension fields", eg fields that we are adding in addition
    to the spec, need to be validated
  - [ ] Update README with a section for each structure
  - [ ] Determine which fields should be require / optional
  - [ ] Understand and reconcile things...
    - [ ] What is the indicator :specifications field for?
    - [ ] Indicator references observables, but the STIX observable is
      different from ours
      - [ ] Name reference to observable in indident.clj
    - [ ] What should the judgement schema look like?
      - [ ] Name judgement references in indicator.clj
  - [ ] Expand exploit_target -> Vulnerability -> :affected_software?
  - [ ] Provide exploit_target -> Vulnerability -> CVSS_Score?
  - [ ] Add NewFoo and StoredFoo for each structure
  - [X] Where relationships are wrapped with scope, confidence, etc., should we
    allow direct references?  (yes)
  - [ ] Consider dropping incident history
  - [ ] Should every structure with an id/idref field be stored (such as Tool)?

* How to convert a STIX specification to one of our schemas:

** Update the data_structures.md document for any schema changes!

** Value practical and concrete over extensible and abstract

** Flatten and simplify when possible

  Especially when a STIX field contains a data structre that is a
  wrapper around a defined vocabulary without adding important fields
  in the wrapping data structure.  In that case, avoid the wapper and
  use an enum for the vocabulary.

** Record any omitted fields in comments at the bottom of each structure.

** Note which fields are added by us (not part of STIX).

** Prefer references to nested data structures.

  Use named references so that we can tell what the reference points at.

** References should point to stored object types.

** Use capital letters in identifiers and keywords for acronyms.

** Fields should be renamed to their acronyms when we implement the referenced structure.

** Each stored structure should have a NewStructure and StoredStructure schema to match

** Rename fields to shorten smurfy names (eg threat_actor -> actor)

** Rename some other fields, listed below

***  information_source -> source
