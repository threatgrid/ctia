#+Title: Contributing

* Introduction

This document introduces how to minimize the friction between contributors.
It is mainly written for developers.

So if you are a new developer in our team, welcome! Please read carrefully do
not hesitate to reach out if you want to discuss something about this document.

- git / deploiement workflow

* Coding Style

** Syntax

The code should follow the following guidelines:

https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide

Mainly it states that the syntax should be the one provided by default with emacs.
Most (every) developer use emacs right now to contribute.

** Guidelines

The motivations for these guidelines are code readability and also management of
code complexity:

- Select meaningful names for functions and variables. Avoid acronyms that
  aren't commonly known.
- Prefer rewriting code to make it clear over adding comments. If that cannot be
  achieved, add comments.
- Limit the number of functions invoked in a single line of code to five.
- Limit the nested depth of a function definition to four. In order to achieve
  this it may be necessary to introduce local variables to hold intermediate
  results or extract code into additional function definitions.
- Only use anonymous functions for short function definitions that fit
  comfortably on a single line. Otherwise create a private, named function.
- Do not write anonymous functions that have arguments that are anonymous
  functions.
- Make an effort to limit the depth of the code. Mainly, you should reach a lib
  or core function as soon as possible while following the functions of a
  namespace. Other member of the team should not need to open more than three
  namespaces at a time to reach all the functions necessary to understand your
  code.
- Do not use loop/recur unless you can't use reduce. Do not use reduce unless
  you can't use a combination/threading of functions.
- Never use ~defmacro~ unless you really can't use a function and every other
  member of the team couldn't find a better way.
- Never use ~defmethod~.
- Only use ~defprotocol~ for declaring TK services. Never use it unless you
  can't do otherwise. Most of the time using ~case~ and/or ~cond~ will be preferable.
- Try to avoid the use of ~core.async~ there is certainly an easier, simpler and
  less bug prone way to do what you intend to.

** Backward Compatibility

We work in a production environment.
Once a code is in production, people are using in some way, we can't break it.

Try to make your code upgrade proof.
Inspired from (Spec-ulation talk of Rich Hickey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk).
Ask yourself the questions:

- "Will we be able to upgrade without downtime?"
- "Will it be easy to put that new code in production without breaking the service?"
- "Will that change imply to run a data migration in production?"
- "Will that change break the workflow of any client?"
- "How easy will it be to upgrade the configuration?"
- "What will occur if the 3rd party change slightly their data format?".

For example: notice that adding new fields to the configuration is not as
expensive as modifying it or removing a key, because it will force that the
deploiement of the conf and of the code to be synchronized. While if you can add
new fields, you can upgrade the configuration before upgrading the code in
production without any downtime.

- For most spec/schemas, make them as permissive as possible.
  For example ~(defschema Conf {:port s/Int})~ is not as permissive as
  as ~(defschema Conf {:port s/Int s/Any s/Any})~.
  Because if the configuration change we would be able to add new fields
  to the configuration without breaking the running version.
- Only add new fields, new values.
  Because modifying the type of a value or removing a field will
  break between different version of the code.
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  OK:     (s/enum :a :b) => (s/enum :a :b :c)
  NOT OK: (s/enum :a :b :c) => (s/enum :a :b)

  OK:     {:a s/Int} => {:a s/Int :b s/Bool}
  NOT OK: {:a s/Int} => {:a s/Bool}
  #+END_SRC


* Git / Deploiement Workflow

In our team, GitHub is currently used both as a developer tool and as a task
management tool. This document only focus about the developer tool aspect.

** Git / Github

Our workflow is close to the Gitlab flow (see:
https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/)

*** Init your env

1) Clone the ctia repo in github to have your own clone say (where =johndoe= is your nick):
   =https://github.com/johndoe/ctia=.
2) Add a =tg= remote for the main =threatgrid/ctia= repository:
   =git remote add tg https://github.com/threatgrid/ctia=
3) =./init-local-git-config.sh=

You shall now have:

- a default git commit template
- an alias: =git synctg= that shall sync your =origin/master= with the =threatgrid/master= correctly.

You can test everything is working correctly by doing:

#+BEGIN_SRC
> docker-compose -f containers/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
> lein test
> lein run -m ctia.main
#+END_SRC

*** Adding a new feature / fixing an issue

1. You should have an open issue in github with number ~#XXX~.
2. ~git checkout -b issue-XXX-issue-short-description~
3. work... make a some ~git commit~;
   the first time do not use the =-m= option, then for all other commits,
   you shall use a =git commit -m= with short messages (<50 char is best).
4. Optionally clean up your git log history by doing a
   ~git synctg~ and then a ~git rebase -i master~.
   Do not remove the first commit message with the Release block.
5. Test locally ~./build/compile.sh && ./build/run-tests.sh && lein tk~
6. ~git push -u~ will push and create the branch on github
7. Open a PR. In the PR reference the issue, follow the instructions of the template.
8. Make changes according to PR feedbacks
9. Either use the =Squash & Merge button= in github or manually rebase.

*** Deployment

We currently have three environments.

| Integration (INT) | https://intel.int.iroh.site          | master    |
| Integration (INT) | https://private.intel.int.iroh.site  | master    |
| TEST              | https://intel.test.iroh.site         | rel-X.X.X |
| TEST              | https://private.intel.test.iroh.site | rel-X.X.X |
| PROD              | https://intel.amp.cisco.com          | rel-X.X.X |
| PROD              | https://private.intel.amp.cisco.com  | rel-X.X.X |

There could be two cases:

**** Classical: all features from INT to go up to PROD

That's the easiest case. QA works on TEST environment and file bugs.

If a bug is found by QA. Make the PR for Int, and tag it (with a github label,
not git tags) with the release version accordingly.

**** Release Workflow: some feature won't go up from INT to PROD

In that case, a branch will be created that won't contains some commits of master.

If a bug is found by QA. Make the PR from the rel-X.X.X branch.

And also you should (most of the time) use the same branch to make another PR
directly from INT or manually cherry-pick the PR from rel-X.X.X to INT. That
work of bringing back a fix from release down to INT SHOULD NOT be done by QA.

We should NEVER make any commit goes down.
Only from INT to TEST and from TEST to PROD or directly from TEST to PROD.
This is why it is your duty not to forget to make two PRs, one to fix TEST the
over one to fix INT.

**** Configuration Modification

Any change that need a configuration change must be handled in the ~tenzin~
repository. The detail about how to do that are out of the scope of this document.
