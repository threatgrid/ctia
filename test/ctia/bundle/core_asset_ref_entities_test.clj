  "Additonal tests for entities with AssetRef field.

  For Assets, (unlike other entities) it was decided not to use Relationship
  objects to define association with other entities. Specifically, AssetMap and
  AssetProperties are linked to Assets via their :asset-ref fields.

  These tests are to ensure that such a relationship is observed when these
  types of objects when they created via Bundle Import"
