;; === Access Control Test Scenario workflow: ===

;; - Player 1 is isolated, Player 2-3 in same group
;; - Each Player creates a Record with a given TLP
;; - Test Player 2 attempts access on Player 1 R/W
;; - Test Player 3 attempts access on Player 1 R/W
;; - Test a List query for Each Player
;; - Player 2 Attempts deleting Player 3 entity
;; - Repost Deleted entities

;; - Player 1 Allows Player 2

;; - Test Player 2 attempts access on Player 1 R/W
;; - Test Player 3 attempts access on Player 1 R/W
;; - Test a List query for Each Player
;; - Player 2 Attempts deleting Player 3 entity
;; - Repost Deleted entities

;; - Player 1 Allows Player 2-3 Group

;; - Test Player 2 attempts access on Player 1 R/W
;; - Test Player 3 attempts access on Player 1 R/W
;; - Test a List query for Each Player
;; - Player 2 Attempts deleting Player 3 entity
